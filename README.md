## **What's Caramel?**

First of all, Caramel is not a custom Minecraft client. It's a vanilla Fabric modpack, 
that keeps the changes to a minimum, and makes Minecraft an enjoyable experience once again.

It's packaged in the MMC format, so all Minecraft Launchers should be able to import it!

### It...

- .. has Performance tweaks
- .. respects your privacy
- .. has Shader support
- .. is customizable as you wish.

## Modlist:

- **BetterF3** (with custom config for better performance)
- **Dynamic FPS** (reduces ingame FPS if cursor is out of the window/focus is lost)
- **EntityCulling**
- **Sodium**
- **Iris** (shader support)
- **LambDynamicLights** (Torches emit light)
- **LanguageReload** (faster language reload)
- **LazyDFU** (faster world loading/creation)
- **ModMenu**
- **MouseTweaks**
- **NoTelemetry** (blocks Microsoft's tracking requests)
- **Reese's Sodium Options**
- **SmoothBoot** (optimizes Minecraft's loading performance for lower end PC's)
- **Starlight** (Optimization for Minecraft's lighting engine)

By standard, this pack has selected all the lowest settings as to give it the most FPS - you may edit your
settings to your wish!

There should be a single release of Caramel for every Minecraft version that comes out in the future.
