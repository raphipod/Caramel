## **What's Caramel?**

First of all, Caramel is not a custom Minecraft client. It's a vanilla Fabric modpack with custom configs, 
that keeps the changes to a minimum, and makes Minecraft an enjoyable experience once again.

The goal is a high framerate and due to the ever rising system requirements every new version, 
this hopefully enables players with weaker systems to play the game with a playable framerate.

It's packaged in the zipped MMC format, so all Minecraft Launchers should be able to import it!
(Only tested with PrismLauncher/MultiMC)

### It...

- .. has Performance tweaks
- .. respects your privacy
- .. has Shader support
- .. is customizable as you wish.

## Modlist:

- **BetterF3** (with custom config for better performance)
- **Dynamic FPS** (reduces ingame FPS if cursor is out of the window/focus is lost)
- **EntityCulling** (non-visible entities are culled out)
- **Sodium**
- **Iris** (shader support)
- **ImmediatelyFast** (custom framebuffer implementation & uploads data to GPU more efficiently)
- **LanguageReload** (faster language reload)
- **NoTelemetry** (blocks Microsoft's tracking requests)
- **Reese's Sodium Options**
- **Starlight** (Optimization for Minecraft's lighting engine)

By standard, this pack has selected all the lowest settings as to give it the most FPS - you may edit your
settings to your wish!

There should be a single release of Caramel for every stable major Minecraft version that comes out in the future.

Those releases are tested and known to be compatible with the assigned MC version.
You may update Caramel with the newest mod updates, though no support is given if any errors occur.
