# Caramel

## **What's Caramel?**

First of all, Caramel is not a custom Minecraft client. It's a vanilla Fabric modpack, that keeps the changes to a minimum, and  
makes Minecraft an enjoyable experience once again.

It's packaged in the MMC format, so all Minecraft Launchers should be able to import it!

### It...

- .. has Performance tweaks
- .. respects your privacy
- .. has Shader support
- .. is customizable as you wish.

There should be a single release of Caramel for every Minecraft version that comes out in the future.
